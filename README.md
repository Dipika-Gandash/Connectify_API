# ✅ Validations & Security
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt

Strong password rules enforced (min 8 chars, 1 upper, 1 lower, 1 symbol, 1 number)

Token is verified in userAuth middleware before protected routes

Input data is validated using validator.js and Mongoose rules

Users can't send duplicate or self-requests
